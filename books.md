The current project is [an introductory VimL book](http://fifthposition.org/viml-book-to-occur/), to be published by the Pragmatic Programmers. I will put more on it here as more becomes available.

### *Grails 2: A Quick-Start Guide*

| &#8220;Java web development is notoriously tedious, but help is on the way. Grails takes the pain out of web development and brings back the fun. This beginner’s guide gets you up and running with Grails as you construct an original, working application from start to finish. In this new edition, you’ll be building an application entirely with Grails 2, which allows you to take advantage of the new HTML 5 scaffolding, dramatic performance improvements, and enhancements new to Groovy 2.&#8221; <br /><br /> The Pragmatic Bookshelf, 2014.
